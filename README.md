#Project Overview: 

	Water level indicator is the mechanism that will detect the overflow of water in any container or closed space. It will then show the information of overflow to monitor or any other output device. It will also detect if the water level has dropped remarkably in that container or closed space. Water level indicator uses probe sensors which basically detects if the water level is high or low. But for this reason a combination of high and low sensors are used which distinguish if the water level is too high or too low. 


The probe sensors are placed at different positions of the container  When the water level drops than the lower probe then the signal is sent and either the monitor shows a promt or an alarm is triggered and the motor starts to fill the container. Again, when the water level reaches the highrer probe then the motor stops fillng the container. The water level indicator works on this basic strategy.


The purpose behind choosing this water level indicator as our project is mainly to help in water management. As Bangladesh faces difficulties in managing the vast water bodies. So we hope that a proper water level indicator can help resolve this problem. Moreover, our rural areas constantly face flooding due to poor water  management. So we think it is high time to use technology properly in these sectors.

Besides, water level indicators can be used in industries to detect the water level of water tanks and in household water tanks to detect the overflow and stop wastage of water. Besides, it can also be used in swimming pools.
